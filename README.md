1. Create a website that has all the pictures of the original Pokemon (pokemon #1 ~ pokemon #151). Use the PokeAPI to
get the images.
2. You can find the image of the first pokemon on [http://pokeapi.co/media/img/1.png], second pokemon on [http://pokeapi
.co/media/img/2.png], third pokemon on [http://pokeapi.co/media/img/3.png], and so on.
3. When each image is clicked, it should show all information on them individually in a box.
4. Use JQuery and make ajax API call to fetch data from the site.
